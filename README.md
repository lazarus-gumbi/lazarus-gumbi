# ♈ Melusi Lazarus Gumbi

**Software Developer/Programmer**

I'm a full-stack developer with the passion for technology. All my coding projects are built by me from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems. I also have a passion for teaching others what I know as far as programming and software development goes.
